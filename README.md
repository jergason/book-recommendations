# Book Recommendations

One of my favorite things is getting book recommendations. Books are rad, and being exposed to new book recommendations is also rad.

## Books I Recommend
Recommending books is fun, so I'll throw in a few too. In no particular order:

* Designing Data Intensive Applications - An very readable and in-depth look at everything that goes in to data storage and manipulation. If you've ever wondered what a database does when it runs a query, or how different dbs make different tradeoffs in their storage format on disk, or how different replication schemes work, or why you'd ever want to use a streaming system, or what they are good for, or anything touching data systems, this is great.
* Blindsight & Echopraxia - Two books, but they are in the same series and I like them for similar reasons. Most sci-fi aliens are basically "smart humans with a slightly different culture." This is sci-fi based on the premise of *truly* alien aliens. What would intelligence look like without consciousness? It is dark and brooding and full of twists and also there are space-vampires. These *might* be my favorite sci-fi books.
* The Algorithm Design Manual - Somehow the author writes about algorithms and data structures and it is . . . entertaining? I found this struck the perfect balance between readability and rigor for me. Full of stories of applications of algorithms to real-world problems, which helps put them in context.
* Coders at Work - Interviews with software developers you've heard of or should have heard of. Donald Knuth, Fran Allen, Guy Steele and more. I'm fascinated by the history of software. The author is a gifted interviewer that pulls interesting stories and personal details out of these amazing people. One of my favorite parts is how differently they all approach software. Unit tests vs sitting and thinking really hard, print debugging vs tool-assisted, love of C vs hatred of C, and so much more.
* The Trial - Lots of modern life reminds me of this book. A man is arrested but police won't tell him why. He spends the rest of the book navigating a faceless bureaucracy in an attempt to figure out what he is even charged with and when his trial will be. It does not go well. Not a happy book, but I think about it a lot.
* Snow Crash - This *might* be my favorite book. I read it as a teenager so I might be blind to its flaws. Ridiculous over-the-top cyberpunk thriller with all of the knobs cranked up to 11. The protagonist of the story is named Hiro Protagonist. One antagonist is named Raven and has a giant POOR IMPULSE CONTROL tattoo on his forehead. Ah I can't describe it without making it worse. If you enjoy sci-fi, read ths.
* The Making of the Atomic Bomb - Supposedly a historical account of the history of the development of the atomic bomb, but really a deep look at the human side of science. Helps you get to know the people and their flaws and squabbles and competition and cooperation behind the single-paragraph summaries you read about in Chem 101 textbooks.
* More Work For Mother - Historical look at domestic life from the frontier of North America to the 1980s with a focus on how "women's work" has changed over the years. The thesis is that domestic work used to be split evenly between men and women, but the traditionally male labor was automated, freeing men to go work in jobs, while traditionally female work has changed but not been eliminated. Fascinating.
* The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet - Fun little sci-fi book with a great cast of aliens. A Hobbit-like, but with an interesting perspective.
* Amusing Ourselves To Death - Written in the 80s about the affect of entertainment on discourse, thought and culture. Popularized the phrase "the medium is the message." Focused on TV, but outrageously prescient and applicable to the internet age. A short read.
